# My Battle-Ship-Game


*I've created a simple game, where you have to guess the ship's location.*

Using a 10x10 empty matrix, the game will change 10 random zeroes to number one. You will have to guess where those not null numbers are. When you correctly guess a ship's position the matrix will modify it's value to two (at the given coordinates that you just typed).

In short terms, **number one means the pirate has the ship and number two means the ship is conquered**. Be careful the pirate can be cruel!

You wont be able to see the matrix when you play the game, if it becomes too boring or you just dont want to play anymore you can give up; if you do that you will be able to see the matrix and the conquered/unconquered ships.

I always loved those kind of games when I was younger, feel free to modify the number of ships you want to locate and the matrix size
